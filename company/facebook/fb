For my Pirate (systems design & architecture), the interviewer drew up a vague picture of a cat picture inside a cell with a FB profile picture & name at the top of the cell and a "likes" and "comments" counts & buttons at the bottom of the cell.

Design an enumerator (e.g. named FBSuperEnumerator) that has two API's:

- (id) nextObject;
- (NSArray *) allObjects; // all objects remaining

which, when given an input array that has content that can be either NSNumbers or NSArray, will expand all arrays embedded inside it.

That is, given an input of something like @[@1, @[@2, @[@3, @4]], @[ ], @5], each call to nextObject will display items in the expected order.

Here’s a ninja (i.e. supposedly not a heavy) question:

Given an array of numbers, reset the array to put all the non-zero numbers in front of all the zeros in the array, then return the count of non-zero numbers.

e.g., for an input array of [3,0,2,0,0,1,0,4], you’ll end up with a return value of 4 and an array of [3,2,1,4,0,0,0,0]

This is a question from my first interview (back in 2015), and I have a feeling it's still used:
A telephone keypad has letters associated with each number  (e.g. 2 = abc, 3 = def). Given a passphrase of "fb1" (e.g. one that you might use to log into a bank account), come up with an algorithm that would assemble an array that contains all the different possible letter combinations that, when typed into a telephone dial pad, would be equivalent to the original passphrase. That is, "fb1" equals "321" numerically; matching equivalent combinations include: "da1", "db1", "dc1", "ea1", "eb1", "ec1", "fa1" and "fc1

Write an array flatten function.

Write an emitter class:
/*
emitter = new Emitter();

// 1. Support subscribing to events.
sub = emitter.subscribe('event_name', callback);
sub2 = emitter.subscribe('event_name', callback2);

// 2. Support emitting events.
// This particular example should lead to the `callback` above being invoked with `foo` and `bar` as parameters.
emitter.emit('event_name', foo, bar);

// 3. Support unsubscribing existing subscriptions by releasing them.
sub.release(); // `sub` is the reference returned by `subscribe` above
Can you write a function that deeply flattens an array?
 was asked basic Javascript concepts for the phone interview. For the video call I was asked to flatten an array recursively and iteratively in Javascript as well as to do some HTML and CSS design given a picture by the interviewer.

Basic JavaScript async stuff (you should know event bubbling, debounce (its variant)... know how to code it). It would be a good idea to be aware of JS closure as well.

Poll Widget question (just know your positioning, relative, static etc know the differences inside out). You might want to know specificity as well.
If you were building a search tool and wanted search results to pop up as you typed but the server call was taxing, write a function that gets called on every key down but calls the server when the user stops typing for 400ms.
The most difficult question was the initial puzzle, which is a sizeable project. The phone interview was mainly focused on Javascript DOM tree manipulation. On-site questions included a few quick algorithms questions (flatten an array), design/code a poll widget. All of the questions were heavy on JS, which is expected for this position

Given an input array and another array that describes a new index for each element, mutate the input array so that each element ends up in their new index. Discuss the runtime of the algorithm and how you can be sure there won't be any infinite loops.
How many times would `addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);` run as the user looks at their News Feed? And what would be user experience if the `handleScroll` function takes 100ms to execute.
2 Answers
Related to question 1, how could you implement debouncing? Say you wanted the `handleScroll` function to be called only after 200ms has passed between scroll events.
1. In JavaScript, write a function that takes an array as input that can contain both ints and more arrays (which can also contain an array or int) and return the flattened array.

ex. [1, [2, [ [3, 4], 5], 6]] =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

2. Using HTML and CSS, show how you would create an image that would display another image e (aligned to the bottom, right) when the user hovers over the image.
